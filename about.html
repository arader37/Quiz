    <h3 class="directions">This quizmaster project was created in the 2018-2019 school year by SILC's Computer Science Level 2 (JavaScript) class Students. Each of us have picked up a topic and prepared a set of 10-20 questions. We have then plugged in those questions into the Quiz Master application we have developed in the class. We used GitHub to download the master baseline and to ingegrate our changes. Take the quiz and test your knowledge about India and its culture. Enjoy! <br> </h3>
